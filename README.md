# Technologies
* GitHub, used for project control.
* Gitpod, used for making the project.
* Heroku, used for Deployment.

# Bugs
* When I was writing the code I was getting problems with spacing. I fixed that by reading about spaces between python lines and slacks colleagues .

# Remaining Bugs
* No Bugs Remained.

# Project Deployment
* Sign up/ login to [heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login).
* Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJs.
* Link Heroku app to repositry.
* click Deploy.

# Future Enhancement
* players Scores.
* Difficulty Levels.

# Credit 
* Code institute for the deployment terminal.
* Youtube tutorials.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) web used to read bout functions.

# Aknowledge
## I would like to Thank the following :
* Code Institute Team, and my Mentor Antonio Rodriguez.
